version 1.0.5
- Added support for parabolic orbits.
- Updated and expanded sample scenes.
- Added the ability to spawn a transfer trajectory body in EllipticInterceptionSolver.
- Removed some duplicate and unused utility methods.
- Improved precision of KeplerSolver.
- Completely removed all dependencies on UnityEninge inside the KeplerOrbitData and KeplerOrbitUtils.
- Fixed sometimes incorrect initialization of the orbit in KeplerOrbitMover when initilizing the orbit via script.

version 1.0.4
- Added component for orbit interception calculation.
- Minor bugs fixes.

version 1.0.3
- Added orbit elements and orbit vectors constructors for KeplerOrbitData.
- Added some small tools for KeplerOrbitMover and KeplerOrbitLineDisplay.
- Extended Readme and added concept document.

version 1.0.2
- Added Velocuty Handler Scale slider parameter.

version 1.0.1
- Circularize orbit tool now doesn't invert the velocity.
- KeplerOrbitLineDisplay now draws periapsi-apoapsis line instead of ascending-descending nodes, because ecliptic plane is static and not helpful.
- Added second example scene with layered hierarchy of orbiting objects.

version 1.0:
- Initial release.
